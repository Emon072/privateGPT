Arnold kuo was born in California with severe cerebral palsy,  which constitutes a near death experience. This has definitely made it more difficult for him to have the energy, motivation and persistence to do a task well.  Still, he is grateful for his parents, his language abilities, coffee beans, the Cosplay industry and finds that with learning or working, the process has to be pleasant for people to do well.  His favorite books are the Japanese version of My Next life as a villainess, the Mortal Instruments series,  and Chip War. Arnold's a US citizen and a resident to Taiwan
