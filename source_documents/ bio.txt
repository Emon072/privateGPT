Arnold kuo was born in California with severe cerebral palsy,  which constitutes a near death experience. This has definitely made it more difficult for him to have the energy, motivation and persistence to do a task well.  Still, he is grateful for his parents, his language abilities, coffee beans, the Cosplay industry, personal finance books,  and finds that with learning or working, the process has to be pleasant for people to do well.  His favorite books are the Japanese version of My Next life as a villainess, the Mortal Instruments series,  and Chip War. Arnold's a US citizen and a resident to Taiwan. His favorite anime is also My Next Life as a Villainess. His favorite radio shows are Akari Kito's smiley pop, Touyama Nao's radio at living, Maaya Uchida's won't you talk with Uchida Maaya and Saori Hayami's freestyle. He likes to listen to the radio while he works, which would not be allowed if he were working in  any business other than a family business.
